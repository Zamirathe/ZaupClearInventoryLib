# ZaupClearInventoryLib

This plugin gives admins back the ability to clear inventories of themselves or others now that it has been removed from Rocket.

# Commands

/ci or /ci self will clear all your items.

/ci [name] will clear someone else's items

/ci [name or self] true will clear yours or someone else's items AND clothing WARNING: MAY BE BUGGY.

# Permissions

ci to clear your own inventory

ci.other to clear someone else's inventory

NOTE: I am aware of an issue where if you clear the clothing and you pick something else up, you will be wearing some non-clothing items.  Not sure what is causing this.  This could also cause someone to not be able to log in after having their inventory clothing cleared.  Please proceed with caution and use at your own risk.
